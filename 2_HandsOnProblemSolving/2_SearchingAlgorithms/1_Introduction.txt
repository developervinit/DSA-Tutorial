//Searching Algorithms ðŸ“š
Welcome to the Searching Algorithms section of this DSA preparation repository!

This folder contains explanations, examples, and implementations of fundamental searching algorithms that form the foundation of problem-solving in computer science. Searching algorithms are designed to locate a specific value or item in a collection, such as an array, list, or string, efficiently.

What's Covered Here?
Currently, we explore the following basic searching algorithms:
1. Linear Search: A simple method to find a target by checking each element sequentially.
2. Binary Search: An efficient divide-and-conquer approach for sorted collections.
3. Naive String Search: A straightforward way to locate substrings in a given text.

These algorithms are explained with easy-to-follow examples and code, making them beginner-friendly. More advanced searching techniques will be added in the future to expand your learning.

Explaining other searching algorithms that are frequently used in problem-solving and interviews. many of these will be added in future. Here's a list of must-learn searching algorithms:
 
Basic Searching Algorithms:-----
1. Linear Search
    -Foundation for understanding searching logic.
    -Good for unsorted data and small datasets.
2. Binary Search
    -Critical for sorted data and understanding divide-and-conquer.
    -Forms the basis for advanced techniques like binary search on the answer.


Intermediate Searching Algorithms:-----
1. Ternary Search
    -Similar to binary search but divides the range into three parts.
    -Useful for unimodal functions and optimization problems.
2. Jump Search
    -Optimized for sorted arrays with a step-based approach.
    -A step up from linear search for sorted data.

3. Exponential Search
    -Extends binary search for finding the range first.
    -Suitable for large sorted datasets.

4. Interpolation Search
    -Efficient for uniformly distributed sorted data.
    -Improves upon binary search by predicting where the target is.

Search in Graphs and Trees:-----
1. Depth-First Search (DFS)
    -Essential for traversing graphs and solving problems like connected components, cycles, etc.
    
2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    -Crucial for level-order traversal and shortest path in unweighted graphs.

3. Trie-Based Search
    -Efficient for prefix-based problems.
    -Used in autocomplete systems and dictionary lookups.


--------------------------------------------------------

What to Focus On?
-Master Binary Search, DFS, and BFS as they are fundamental.
-Learn KMP, Boyer-Moore, and Rabin-Karp for pattern matching.
-Understand Trie for prefix-based searches.
-Practice applying these algorithms in real problems (e.g., on LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces).

Note:- By focusing on these, you'll cover all the critical search techniques for DSA preparation.
