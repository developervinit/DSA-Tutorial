//Here we are learning some problem solving patterns.

// Here we are learning that How do you get better at solving them, whether it's in an interview or on a side project working on?

//So here we are discussing two different steps for solving problems.
Step-1. Device a plan for solving problems.
Step-2. Master common problem solving patterns.

//So according to step 1 we can device our own plan to solve a particular problem or we can use problem solving patterns.

//Now we are doing step 2

//there are some common patterns that we'll discuss that do apply to multiple problems that are common approaches to writing code sort of arch types or a problem. But that does not mean that you cover every possible scenario on earth. So it might help you in one out of five, one out of ten challenges you have to face. But even if it's only one out of ten, that's still helpful and worth knowing.
//So there are lots of these patterns and some of them have names that are official. Some of them have names, well, not official, but names that are recognized by other people, like divide and conquer, for example, or greedy algorithms.


//So there are some patterns following which you can master to solve the problem.
1. Frequency counter.    
2. Multiple pointers.  
3. Sliding window.      
4. Divide and Conquer.  
5. Dynamic Programming. 
6. Greedy Algorithm.    
7. BackTracking   //       
8. Two Pointers 
9. Fast & Slow Pointers
10. Islands (Matrix Traversal)
11. Merge Intervals
12. Cyclic Sort
13. In-place Reversal of a LinkedList
14. Tree Breadth-First Search
15. Tree Depth First Search
16. Two Heaps
17. Subsets
18. Modified Binary Search
19. Bitwise XOR
20. Top ‘K’ Elements
21. K-way Merge
22. Topological Sort
23. 0/1 Knapsack
24 Fibonacci Numbers
25. Palindromic Subsequence
26. Longest Common Substring
